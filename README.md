# AI for Dementia

## Definitions and acronyms
* **Dementia:** “Dementia is a term used to describe a group of symptoms affecting memory, thinking and social abilities severely enough to interfere with your daily life. It isn't a specific disease, but several diseases can cause dementia.” [[1](#1)]
* **PwD:** Person(s) with dementia
* **PwD<sub>r</sub>:** PwD responses
* **BPSD:** Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia
* **BPSD<sub>d</sub>:** BPSD mainly related with emotional distress (i.e., verbal aggression, frustration, anger), as observed by a PwD’s caregiver

## Project description
This repository includes the work towards the design, development and implementation
of a smart agent capable of detecting and/or predicting BPSD that involved distress. The smart agent will be capable to react according to the detected/predicted emotional distress response in order to improve the quality of life of the PwD as well of the caregiver.

We begin with the hypothesis that signals representative of PwD<sub>r</sub> (e.g., audio, video, inertial/movement measurements, physiological signals, speech, Bluetooth sightings as a measure of social context) can be used to train smart agents to automate the detection (occurrence of a BPSD<sub>d</sub>) and prediction (prior to the onset of a BPSD<sub>d</sub>) of emotional distress (anger, frustration, anxiety) in PwD, reacting accordingly to improve their quality of life as well as of their caregivers.
